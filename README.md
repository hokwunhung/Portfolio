Hi,

The following demo is built using Unity Engine 5.2.1.

To start the demo please use "Final.exe". 

There are total of 3 games inside this demo:

CrateDropper is a game of dodging collisions.
Controls are WASD for movement and space for jumping.

Drawde is a jenga style game where you are trying to stack the boxes as high as possible.
Simply left click to drop the box down. The capsule act as the aimbox.

Escape is a top down room escape game. The goal is to find the key from gameobjects and get out of the room.
Left click onto terrain to move, right click to inspect objects to find key. Left click on surface again to cancel inspection.

Press escape for pause/main menu in any game mode.

Within the Asset/Scripts/ folder, there is a CustomWindowScript.cs. This is a tool for easier finding and replacing gameobjects or models in a huge scene.

Please note that other than default game character and destrutible crates script, all other gameobjects and scripts are created by me.
